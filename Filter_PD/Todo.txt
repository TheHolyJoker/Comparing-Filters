Hashing:
Check faster hash function.
Fix permutation of zero.

Template:
Making all testing function as templates.
Setting PD as an interface.

Memory:
Invalid_Free?

Cuckoo filter:
Start using it.



False positive ratio is a bit too high.
Possible reasons:
1) choice of two. (unlikely)
2) no permutation on the quotient. (why does it matter?).
3) the parameter "m" in the PD, is not used correctly.
4) bad use in the hash function.
